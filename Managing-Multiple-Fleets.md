## Managing Multiple Fleets

If you want to segregate your fleets, to either help with management and distribution of Hivemapper Dashcams or perhaps if you have different fleet partnerships that you help to run, this can be easily done.

### Creating Accounts in Phantom

Create a new account by either clicking the + icon or the "Add / Connect Wallet" button.

Do this for as many accounts as you'd like.
You can rename each account to help you stay organized by click on the menu icon again, and selecting the Accounts tab once more.
Click on the 3 dots next to the acconut you'd like to rename

Once signed out, you'll be able to sign in with a different account and you can start your fleet building process once again.

## Create Accounts for Your Drivers

Some Fleet Managers would like to create accounts for their drivers. This allows you to:

1. Become a recovery partner for your drivers, should they lose access to their account
2. Skip the need to teach your drivers how to setup an account through Phantom and understand public keys/private keys
3. You can handle all of the Join Fleet signup yourself, and then simply give them a camera and input some information on their phone for them, 
making it truly hands off for your driver to get started

### Best Practices

It is recommended to create a fresh Phantom Wallet for your drivers, so that you keep some separation between your Fleet Owner account (which
controls your entire fleet) and the accounts of the drivers. While this is not necessary, it is a good security practice to limit any potential risks
you can encounter. 


#### Create a New Browser Profile
To do this, on your laptop/desktop computer you can create a secondary profile within your browser

INSERT LINK EXPLAINING, AND A SCREENSHOT

Once you have this new profile created, you can add the Phantom extension (ADD LINK).
Be sure to safely secure your 12-word recovery phrase. 

#### Create Driver Accounts

Within Phantom, you can create as many accounts as you need.

#### Whitelist Driver Accounts

Be sure to check off each driver account so that they will be added to your ACL before locking your cameras. 
This is also a good time to set your token splits.
